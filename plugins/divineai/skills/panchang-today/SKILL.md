# Panchang for a city

Use this for "aaj ki tithi kya hai?", "today's panchang in Varanasi", "nakshatra in London today".

## Steps

1. Find the city. If none is given and the tool asks for one, ask the user for their city in one short line.
2. Call `get_panchang` with the city slug from the tool's list (for example "varanasi", "new-delhi", "new-york") and a date if the user gave one.
3. If festivals are listed for that day, mention them.

## Answer format

- City, date, time zone.
- Sunrise and sunset.
- Tithi (paksha) with end time, nakshatra with end time, yoga and karana.
- One line on the method (computed for the city) and the DivineAI link.

## House rules (apply to every answer)

- Explicit user instructions take priority over this skill, except the safety rules below.
- Use only what the DivineAI tools return. Never invent a festival date, tithi, time, vrat rule or prayer text. A festival marked "date to be confirmed" has no confirmed date: say so and do not guess one.
- Always say which city, time zone and date a panchang is for. Times are local to that city.
- Fasting is personal: anyone unwell, pregnant, diabetic or on medicine should check with their doctor first. No astrology predictions, remedies or muhurat promises. No medical claims.
- No prices: DivineAI tools carry none, and you must not quote any. These tools are read-only: never claim to book, remind, sign up or pay. For pujas, yatras or reminders, point to the DivineAI app (App Store / Google Play) or the "Open in DivineAI" link the tool returns.
- Reply in the user's language (Hindi in Devanagari, Hinglish or English). Use respectful names (Shri Ram, Bhagwan Shiv, Maa Durga). Do not rank traditions. Keep answers short.
